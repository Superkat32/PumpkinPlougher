# Pumpkin Plougher
## Plough your way through the speed of sound with the sculk-powered engine-welding Pumpkin Plougher while defeating evil zombie pumpkins!
#### Made for SpookyJam 2024!

Introducing a very unhinged idea: The Pumpkin Plougher! A netherite hoe with wheels and a sculk-powered engine that moves way too fast for your own good. It is very effective at ploughing through undead monsters, enemies wearing pumpkins, oh - and normal pumpkin blocks too.

By combining the power of two carved pumpkins together, you can create a Spooky Pumpkin which, when used, summons the Raise of The Pumpkins minigame. You have 100 seconds to keep evil zombie pumpkins at bay. Should you succeed, you get rewarded with some pumpkin pie!

There's also a harder, more rewarding version of Raise of The Pumpkins which can be created by combining sculk with a Spooky Pumpkin. Zombie pumpkins spawn more often, have stronger weapons, but give you more rewards should you win.

## Crafting Recipes

### Pumpkin Plougher
The Pumpkin Plougher can be created by combining a netherite hoe with a sculk catalyst, 2 sculk blocks, a chain block, a netherite block, and a carved pumpkin.

### Spooky Pumpkins
A normal Spooky Pumpkin can be created by combining 2 carved pumpkins together.

A Spooky Sculky Pumpkin can be created by combining a sculk block with a Spooky Pumpkin.

## Fun Facts
- The Pumpkin Plougher's weapon design as a whole was heavily inspired by Splatoon 3's Grizzco Roller. 
- The Raise of The Pumpkins minigame was also slightly inspired by Splatoon 3's Salmon Run gamemode, but on a smaller scale because I only wanted it to showoff the ridiculousness of the Pumpkin Plougher.
- This entire mod, starting with the Pumpkin Plougher model, was created within about 3 and a half days.
- The Pumpkin Plougher's development time was about the same time it took to create the Raise of The Pumpkins minigame. Testing and all.
- I hope to create more unhinged custom weapons in the future :)
